I used simple words while creating my First web page( beginner level)# Checkmate
I used simple headings.
I focussed mire on colors and styles ( css)
I listed my about me and gave a summary using brackets.
I used bullet points to highlight a few information.
I used colors to give a brief summary about myself.
I used friendly headings and colors like pink.
